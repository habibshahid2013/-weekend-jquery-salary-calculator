<Select>

<input>

<input>  
<Button><Button>

<Form>

<table>
	<Thread>
		<tr>
			<td></td>
			<td></td>
			<td></td>
			<td></td>

			<td></td>
			<td></td>
			<td></td>
		<tr>
	<Thread>
<table>

Now Style Your Html:
1. Use chrome browser to experiment with your CSS. 
2. Then Copy Css changes into VS Code. 
3. Then commit changes. 
4. Click Inspect:
5. ADD
	1. font size:
	2. padding:
	3. margin right :
	4. margin bottom:
6. Then Commit: 

Install Jquery into VSCOde
	1. script it 
	2. test it 
Install JS. File into VSCODE
	1. Script it 
	2. Test IT 
	3. ADD $(Document).ready(onReady);
	4. ADD Function on Ready(){log.console("so Ready")
	5. }
	6. Add 
```
$('#redBox').on('submit', onSubmit);
```
	1. ADD ID to Form. 
$('#IDofForm').on('click',onSubmit);

1. Function onSubmit(event){
	1. event.preventDefault()
	2. log.console.(__'on Submit'____)
	3. Event passes through various properties. 
		1. It passes various information beginning 
	4. 
Grab values from Form 


- From there you want to test 
- Add Focus and input:
- Add Clear Input:
  
- Use  .val instead of . empty

The power of how the chrome can manipulate a focus area 'input' for example: 


- Then test
- Then Commit: 

Then you want to render the work: 
The <Tbody> should get an ID


Copy and past Tbody into Java script 


step 2:


Then the result should be in testing it: 

Apply fixed on price:


how to:


Then Commit again:

Then add div: 

do some css.
Give css a class selector.


ADD in DIV.

Then do $(_'#totalprice').text(....
To set total price.


make a empty variable that also global variable.
aka product's:

Then push product and log 

then test it: 


then you can calculate the total price using a loop:
test with total price :



Test in chrome

Then Commit: 


Test Step: 
---
Refactoring is changing code to see how it works: 

Step of refactoring: 
comment out product:


empty out table first:


Loop through and append each product: 

Then Test:

Common tool to use is to empty out table and render through the data:



Check your todo list:
Then test everything again:
Then clean up code and put in comments.


put long code in smaller function
